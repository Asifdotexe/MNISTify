# MNISTify
Handwritten digit recognition is crucial in computer vision, with applications in form digitization, automated data entry, and postal code recognition. This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the MNIST dataset to accurately recognize digits. A Streamlit app allows users to upload images and view real-time predictions.
